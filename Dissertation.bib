abstract = {Modern electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) require a reliable battery management system (BMS). The remaining energy and the state-of-energy (SoE) are very important indexes for the embedded BMS used in both EV and HEV applications. As a case study in the embedded BMS, this paper presents the implementation of remaining energy prediction based on the lC/OS-II real time operating system (RTOS). In considering that there are accumulated errors caused by inevitable drift noise of the current or voltage sensors, a model based SoE estimator is developed based on a first-order RC equivalent circuit model. Moreover, the Bayesian learning technique is used for SoE estimation to get accurate and robustness estimation results. Lastly, two different kinds of batteries are carried out under laboratory experiments and real road test to verify the robustness of the proposed SoE estimation approach. The results indicate that the maximum absolute estimation error (MAEE) and the root-mean square error (RMSE) are within 2{\%} and 1{\%} for both LiFePO4 and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 batteries.},

abstract = {Electric city buses and high power charging systems have been rapidly developed in recent years. Battery electric buses are energy efficient and emission free but due to the expensive technology, lifecycle costs can be much higher in comparison to diesel or hybrid buses. This research presents a lifecycle cost analysis for a fleet operation of electric city buses in different operating routes. The objective is to define charging power and battery requirements as well as energy consumption and lifecycle costs. A specific simulation tool was developed to comprehensively evaluate electric buses in different operating conditions. The tool allows to systematically generate and simulate different operating scenarios with a chosen bus configuration, charging method and operating route. Based on the simulation results and predefined cost parameters, lifecycle costs are calculated for each operating scenario. The considered charging methods include overnight, end station and opportunity charging. Simulation results are presented for four operating routes which were measured from existing bus lines in Finland and California, USA. The results show that high energy capacity of the battery system is crucial for the overnight charging buses to achieve adequate daily operation whereas the battery size has a minor impact on the energy consumption and lifecycle costs of the fast charging buses. The lifecycle costs of electric buses are heavily impacted by capital costs including purchase costs of the buses and charging devices. When considering 12 years of service life, the end station charging electric buses can have slightly lower lifecycle costs than diesel buses but on average they have 7{\%} higher lifecycle costs. The overnight charging buses have on average 26{\%} and opportunity charging buses 35{\%} higher lifecycle costs than diesel buses.},

abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have limited energy storage capacity and the maximum autonomy range is strongly dependent of the driver's behaviour. Due to the fact of that batteries cannot be recharged quickly during a journey, it is essential that a precise range prediction is available to the driver of the EV. With this information, it is possible to check if the desirable destination is achievable without a stop to charge the batteries, or even, if to reach the destination it is necessary to perform an optimized driving (e.g., cutting the air-conditioning, among others EV parameters). The outcome of this research work is the development of an Electric Vehicle Assistant (EVA). This is an application for mobile devices that will help users to take efficient decisions about route planning, charging management and energy efficiency. Therefore, it will contribute to foster EVs adoption as a new paradigm in the transportation sector.},

abstract = {Hybrid electric vehicles offer an immediate solution for emissions reduction and fuel displacement under the current technique level. Energy management strategies are critical for improving fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles. In this paper we propose a energy management strategy for a series-parallel plug-in hybrid electric bus based on deep deterministic policy gradients. Specifically, deep deterministic policy gradients is an actor-critic, model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that can assign the optimal energy split of the bus over continuous spaces. We consider that the buses are driving in a fixed bus line, where driving cycle is constrained by the traffic. The traffic information and number of passengers are also incorporated into the energy management system. The deep reinforcement learning based energy management agent is trained with a large amount of driving cycles that generated from traffic simulation. Experiments on the traffic simulation driving cycles show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional reinforcement learning approach and exhibits performance close to the global optimal dynamic programming. Moreover, it also has great generality to the standard driving cycles that are significantly different with the ones that it has been trained with. We also show some interesting attributes of learned energy management strategies through visualizations of the actor and critic. The main contribution of this study is to explore the incorporation of traffic information within hybrid electric vehicle energy managment through advanced intelligent algorithms.},

Meanwhile, capacity, widely used as a health indicator of a battery (HI), is inconvenient or even impossible to measure. Aiming at practical and precise prediction of the RUL of satellite Li-ion batteries, a dynamic long short-term memory (DLSTM) neural-network-based indirect RUL prognosis is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an indirect HI based on the Spearman correlation analysis method is extracted from the battery discharge voltages, and the relationship between the indirect HI indices and battery capacity is established using a polynomial fitting method. Then, by integrating the Adam method, L2 regularization method, and incremental learning, a DLSTM method is proposed and applied for Li-ion battery RUL prognosis. Finally, verification of the results on NASA {\#}5 battery data sets demonstrates that the proposed method has better dynamic performance and higher accuracy than the three other popular methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, a real-time energy management algorithm for charging a plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) network in a large urban area with renewable energy resources is proposed. In this system, the PEVs charging rates are controlled by a central aggregator through wireless communication. A statistical forecasting model of the energy requirement of the PEVs network at different times during the day is developed based on statistical US drivers' driving habits. With historical solar irradiance, and wind speed in this area, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal scale of the renewable farm that can feed proper power for the PEVs network. Meanwhile, this urban area has a certain amount of local load that follows a daily pattern. Through vehicle to grid (V2G) and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) services, the proposed power optimization algorithm based on fuzzy logic control is used to minimize the impact of charging PEVs to the power grid, maximize the utilization of renewable energy and help the power grid to regulate the utility frequency, which will benefit the utility AC grid, PEVs network and its customers. The simulation results based on a large PEVs network demonstrate that the proposed smart charging algorithm can effectively limit the PEVs charging impact and help the grid regulate the frequency.},

However, the absence of flexible strategies reflecting the self-interests of EV users may reduce their participation in this kind of initiative. In this work, we are proposing an intelligent charging strategy using Machine Learning (ML) tools, to determine when to charge the EV during connection sessions. This is achieved by making real-time charging decisions based on various auxiliary data, including driving, environment, pricing, and demand time series, in order to minimize the overall vehicle energy cost. The first step of the approach is to calculate the optimal solution of historical connection sessions using dynamic programming. Then, from these optimal decisions and other historical data, we train ML models to learn how to make the right decisions in real time, without knowledge of future energy prices and car usage. We demonstrated that a properly trained deep neural network is able to reduce charging costs significantly, often close to the optimal charging costs computed in a retrospective fashion.},

abstract = {The limited driving range is considered as a significant barrier to the spread of electric vehicles. One effective method to reduce “range anxiety” is to offer accurate information to the driver on the remaining driving range. However, the energy consumption during driving is largely determined by driving behaviour, road topography information and traffic situation, which are hard to predict. This paper will discuss an accurate electric vehicle energy consumption model validated using driving tests on different public roads, and then the model is used to predict future energy consumption based on road information. The energy consumption model includes five parts: the road load model, the powertrain loss model, the regenerative braking model, the auxiliary system model and the battery model. The parameters of these models are obtained through driving tests on public road and dynamometer tests in the TU/e Automotive Engineering Science lab. The results show that the model can calculate the energy consumption with a maximum error of 5{\%} based on driving speed under different circumstances. To predict the future energy consumption, the road information is obtained from OpenStreetMap and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. An offline algorithm is built to predict the energy consumption for a future trip based on the road information. The algorithm gives two energy consumption results: one is for the fastest driving speed; the other one is for the most economic driving speed. The results show that the measured energy consumption results for different types of road driving are all within the algorithm's prediction scope. Therefore, the offline algorithm can give an accurate energy consumption estimation to the driver before a trip begins.},

We developed a model to simulate battery terminal voltage as a function of state of charge under dynamic loading conditions.

The results are supported and validated using data available from an experimental campaign where the Nissan Leaf was driven to depletion across a broad range of winter ambient temperatures. The effect of ambient temperature and the consequent accessories consumption due to cabin heating are shown to be remarkable. For instance, in case of Federal Urban Driving Schedule (FUDS), simplified FUDS (SFUDS), and New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) driving cycles, the range exceeds 150 km at 20 °C, while it reduces to about 85 km and 60 km at 0 °C and −15 °C, respectively.

Real-world data of EV energy consumption are used to construct the energy consumption calculation models. Based on the vehicle dynamics equation as underlying physical model, multiple linear regression is used to construct three models. Each model uses a different level of aggregation of the input parameters, allowing predictions using different types of available input parameters. One model uses aggregated values of the kinematic parameters of trips. This model allows prediction with basic, easily available input parameters such as travel distance, travel time, and temperature. The second model extends this by including detailed acceleration data. The third model uses the raw data of the kinematic parameters as input parameters to predict the energy consumption. Using detailed values of kinematic parameters for the prediction in theory increases the link between the statistical model and its underlying physical principles, but requires these parameters to be available as input in order to make predictions. The first two models show similar results. The third model shows a worse fit than the first two, but has a similar accuracy. This model has great potential for future improvement.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

Its state-of-health (SOH) estimation is a key technology in the battery management system (BMS). Many battery parameters can reflect the battery's health, like internal resistance, internal capacity, etc. In this paper, we use maximum available capacity to indicate the battery's SOH based on a back propagation (BP) neural network. The main contributions of this paper include: (1) a direct parameter extraction method by HPPC (Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization) test is employed to identify the battery parameters of the first-order equivalent circuit model. (2) The parameters can be used to train the three-layer BP neural network, therefore the structure and parameters including weights and thresholds of the network can be determined. This well-trained neural network is used to estimate the SOH. (3) The static and dynamic current profile tests are carried out to verify the accuracy of the training results of the proposed neural network. The experimental results indicate that the proposed neural network based estimation method can present accuracy and suitability for SOH estimation with low computation cost.},

Finally, the bottlenecks of current researches and future developing trends of DPTs are given. In general, this paper not only gives a comprehensive analysis and review of existing DPTs but also indicates suitable application scenarios for each prediction algorithm and summarizes potential approaches for handling the prediction inaccuracies, which will help prospective designers to select proper DPTs according to different applications and contribute to the further performance enhancements of PEMSs for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Limited driving range remains one of the barriers for widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). To address the problem of range anxiety, this paper presents an energy consumption prediction method for EVs, designed for energy-efficient routing. This data-driven methodology combines real-world measured driving data with geographical and weather data to predict the consumption over any given road in a road network. The driving data are linked to the road network using geographic information system software that allows to separate trips into segments with similar road characteristics. The energy consumption over road segments is estimated using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model that links the energy consumption with microscopic driving parameters (such as speed and acceleration) and external parameters (such as temperature). A neural network (NN) is used to predict the unknown microscopic driving parameters over a segment prior to departure, given the road segment characteristics and weather conditions. The complete proposed model predicts the energy consumption with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 12-14{\%} of the average trip consumption, of which 7-9{\%} is caused by the energy consumption estimation of the MLR model. This method allows for prediction of energy consumption over any route in the road network prior to departure, and enables cost-optimization algorithms to calculate energy efficient routes. The data-driven approach has the advantage that the model can easily be updated over time with changing conditions.},

With the large penetration of renewable energy, fulfilling the balance between electricity demand and supply is a challenge to the modern power system. According to the UK government, the wind power penetration will reach 30{\%} by the year 2020. The role of electric vehicles (EVs) contributing to frequency response was investigated. A dynamic frequency control strategy which considers the comfort level of vehicle owners was developed for EVs to regulate their power consumption according to the deviation of system frequency. A simulation model of a population of EVs equipped with such control was implemented in Matlab/Simulink platform. In this paper, a simplified Great Britain power system model is used to study the contribution of EVs to dynamic frequency control. The case study showed that using EVs as a demand response resource can greatly reduce the frequency deviations.

Then, the detailed climate control loads are analyzed, and the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) range reductions due to these loads are calculated under different conditions. It is found that in an electric vehicle, the total climate control loads vary with the vehicle speed, HVAC mode and blower level. The ventilation load is the largest climate control load, followed by the solar radiation load. These two add up to more than 80{\%} of total climate control load in summer. The ventilation load accounts for 70.7–83.9{\%} of total heating load under the winter condition. The climate control loads will cause a 17.2–37.1{\%} reduction of NEDC range in summer, and a 17.1–54.1{\%} reduction in winter, compared to the AC off condition.

However, accurate measurement of this diffusion capacitance in real time in an electric or hybrid electric vehicle is not practical. In this paper, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to estimate the battery model parameters including the diffusion capacitance in real time using measurement of current and voltage of the battery.

abstract = {This study presents a novel framework by which the energy consumption of an electric vehicle (EV) or the zeroemissions range of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) may be predicted over a route. The proposed energy prediction framework employs a neural network and may be used either `off-line?? for better estimating the real-world range of the vehicle or 'on-line' integrated within the vehicle??s energy management control system. The authors propose that this approach provides a more robust representation of the energy consumption of the target EVs compared to standard legislative test procedures. This is particularly pertinent for vehicle fleet operators that may use EVs within a specific environment, such as inner-city public transport or the use of urban delivery vehicles. Experimental results highlight variations in EV range in the order of 50{\%} when different levels of traffic congestion and road type are included in the analysis. The ability to estimate the energy requirements of the vehicle over a given route is also a pre-requisite for using an efficient charge blended control strategy within a PHEV. Experimental results show an accuracy within 20??30{\%} when comparing predicted and measured energy consumptions for over 800 different real-world EV journeys.},

Many uncertainties and noises, such as fluctuating current, sensor measurement accuracy and bias, temperature effects, calibration errors or even sensor failure, etc. pose a challenge to the accurate estimation of SOC in real applications. This paper adds two contributions to the existing literature. First, the auto regressive exogenous (ARX) model is proposed here to simulate the battery nonlinear dynamics. Due to its discrete form and ease of implemention, this straightforward approach could be more suitable for real applications. Second, its order selection principle and parameter identification method is illustrated in detail in this paper. The hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) cycles are implemented on the 60AH LiFePO 4  battery module for the model identification and validation. Based on the proposed ARX model, SOC estimation is pursued using the extended Kalman filter. Evaluation of the adaptability of the battery models and robustness of the SOC estimation algorithm are also verified. The results indicate that the SOC estimation method using the Kalman filter based on the ARX model shows great performance. It increases the model output voltage accuracy, thereby having the potential to be used in real applications, such as EVs and HEVs. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Reliable and accurate state of charge (SOC) monitoring is the most crucial part in the design of an electric vehicle (EV) battery management system (BMS). The lithium ion battery (LIB) is a highly complex electrochemical system, which performance changes with age. Therefore, measuring the SOC of a battery is a very complex and tedious process. This paper presents an online data-driven battery model identification method, where the battery parameters are updated using the Lagrange multiplier method. A battery model with unknown battery parameters was formulated in such a way that the terminal voltage at an instant time step is a linear combination of the voltages and load current. A cost function was defined to determine the optimal values of the unknown parameters with different data points measured experimentally. The constraints were added in the modified cost function using Lagrange multiplier method and the optimal value of update vector was determined using the gradient approach. An adaptive open circuit voltage (OCV) and SOC estimator was designed for the LIB. The experimental results showed that the proposed estimator is quite accurate and robust. The proposed method effectively tracks the time-varying parameters of a battery with high accuracy. During the SOC estimation, the maximum noted error was 1.28{\%}. The convergence speed of the proposed method was only 81 s with a deliberate 100{\%} initial error. Owing to the high accuracy and robustness, the proposed method can be used in the design of a BMS for real time applications.},

abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) currently represent a small but rapidly growing part of the transport market. Compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, they offer significant benefits in reduced environmental and noise pollution. The cost of the batteries that power electric vehicles has fallen rapidly, meaning that EVs may soon be as cheap to consumers as conventional vehicles. Increasing use of EVs could have considerable implications for the energy system. Inflexible EV charging could add to peak electricity demand and require expensive network reinforcements. But flexible charging could enable cost-effective decarbonisation of the transport sector, by ensuring that our network is used in a smarter and more flexible way. The transition to EVs should provide substantial benefits to energy consumers, but we know it will also bring challenges. Electricity flows will become increasingly complex and bi-directional, particularly if EVs are used to feed power back to the grid through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. There will be regulatory challenges too. The regulations that govern the energy sector were not explicitly designed with the foresight of EV charging and bundled energy and transport services. Regulation will need to adapt to provide predictability to the EV market and protection to EV users. Given the scale of uncertainty around uptake and charging behaviours, alongside the blurring of typically separated sectoral boundaries (energy and transport), this represents a challenging prospect. This paper on the 'Implications of the transition to Electric Vehicles' 1 is the fifth in our Future Insights series. We aim to inform the debate on how the EV transition will affect the energy system, consumers and regulation in three key areas: • The evolving transport sector-Much of the current public debate overlooks or underestimates the role of wider societal change, and how changes in how we access and use transport will manifest in the energy system. We explore the motivations behind current trends, and what they might mean for the energy and transport sectors. • Implications for consumers and the energy system-We explore where and when EV owners are charging, and what that means, given current market arrangements. We explore the benefits of flexible charging, extracting value out of our existing system as an alternative to network reinforcements. We also examine how broader societal change could influence charging behaviour. • Considerations for regulation-We explore key regulatory considerations such as efficient investment in infrastructure, improving access to charging, how costs and benefits are distributed, and technological interoperability. 2 1 This paper focuses on electrification, but there are other low-carbon transport options, such as hydrogen and biogas. This is beyond the scope of this report.},

abstract = {The modeling of eco-driving behaviors is a key issue in the research of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Most efforts have been made regarding internal combustion vehicles, and few works have been reported in the field of electric vehicles. On the other hand, these behavior analyses are usually conducted through naturalistic driving researches that involve the use of instrumented vehicles, available in a small number, which reduces the impact of the results. This paper presents a system for estimating the remaining charge of an electric vehicle by considering the driving behavior measured using a smartphone. For this purpose, first of all, data measured by the smartphone and by the onboard instrumentation were compared in order to demonstrate that both sources are equivalent and that the former is sufficiently accurate. The driving profiles obtained were then used to estimate the expected battery consumption of the electric vehicle using a Neural Network to represent the model that uses the information provided from the smartphone as input, such as speed, acceleration and jerk. The system has been tested with 10 drivers with a prediction capability of the expected battery consumption higher than 95{\%}. These results show that a smartphone is a tool with a sufficient degree of fidelity to capture data from drivers, and so avoid expensive, complex systems like instrumented vehicles, and it can also be used for estimating energy consumption and predicting the remaining battery charge.},

abstract = {The rollout of electric vehicles (EV) occurring in parallel with the decarbonisation of the power sector can bring uncontested environmental benefits, in terms of CO 2 emission reduction and air quality. This roll out, however, poses challenges to power systems, as additional power demand is injected in context of increasingly volatile supply from renewable energy sources. Smart EV charging services can provide a solution to such challenges. The development of effective smart charging services requires evaluating pre-emptively EV drivers' response. The current practice in the appraisal of smart charging strategies largely relies on simplistic or theoretical representation of drivers' charging and travel behaviour. We propose a random utility model for joint EV drivers' activity-travel scheduling and charging choices. Our model easily integrates in activity-based demand modelling systems for the analyses of integrated transport and energy systems. However, unlike previous charging behaviour models used in integrated transport and energy system analyses, our model empirically captures the behavioural nuances of tactical charging choices in smart grid context, using empirically estimated charging preferences. We present model estimation results that provide insights into the value placed by individuals on the main attributes of the charging choice and draw implications charging service providers.},

abstract = {The uncertainty of operating conditions such as weather and payload cause variations in the energy demand of electric city buses. Uncertain variation in energy demand is a challenge in the design of charging systems and on-board energy storages. To predict the energy demand, a computationally efficient model is required for real-time applications. We present a novel approach to predict energy demand variation with a wide range of uncertain factors. A factor identification is carried out to recognize the range of variation in the operating conditions. A computationally efficient surrogate model is generated based on a previously developed numerical simulation model. The surrogate model is shown to be 10 000 times faster than the numerical model. The surrogate model output corresponds with the numerical model with less than 1{\%} error. The energy demand of the surrogate model varied from 0.43 to 2.30 kWh/km, which is realistic in comparison to previous studies. Successful sensitivity analysis of the surrogate model revealed the most crucial factors. Uncertainty in temperature, rolling resistance and payload contributed most to the variation in energy demand. Variation in these factors should be taken into account when predicting energy consumption and while planning schedules for a bus network.},

Range anxiety is an obstacle to the acceptance of electric vehicles (EVs), caused by drivers' uncertainty regarding their vehicle's state of charge (SoC) and the energy required to reach their destination. Most estimation methods for these variables use simplified models with many assumptions that can result in significant error, particularly if dynamic and environmental conditions are not considered. For example, the combined efficiency of the inverter drive and electric motor varies throughout the route and is not constant as assumed in most range estimation methods. This study proposes an improved method for SoC and range estimation by taking into account location-dependent environmental conditions and timevarying drive system losses. To validate the method, an EV was driven along a selected route and the measured EV battery SoC at the destination was compared with that predicted by the algorithm. The results demonstrated excellent accuracy in the SoC and range estimation, which should help alleviate range anxiety.},

abstract = {We compare the potential of hybrid, extended-range plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles to reduce lifetime cost and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions under various scenarios and simulated driving conditions. We find that driving conditions affect economic and environmental benefits of electrified vehicles substantially: Under the urban NYC driving cycle, hybrid and plug-in vehicles can cut life cycle emissions by 60{\%} and reduce costs up to 20{\%} relative to conventional vehicles (CVs). In contrast, under highway test conditions (HWFET) electrified vehicles offer marginal emissions reductions at higher costs. NYC conditions with frequent stops triple life cycle emissions and increase costs of conventional vehicles by 30{\%}, while aggressive driving (US06) reduces the all-electric range of plug-in vehicles by up to 45{\%} compared to milder test cycles (like HWFET). Vehicle window stickers, fuel economy standards, and life cycle studies using average lab-test vehicle efficiency estimates are therefore incomplete: (1) driver heterogeneity matters, and efforts to encourage adoption of hybrid and plug-in vehicles will have greater impact if targeted to urban drivers vs. highway drivers; and (2) electrified vehicles perform better on some drive cycles than others, so non-representative tests can bias consumer perception and regulation of alternative technologies.

The increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB during cycling at elevated temperature is found to relate mainly to the degradations at the electrodes, and that the degradation of LCO cathode is larger than graphite anode at elevated temperature. In particular, the formation and modification of the surface films on the electrodes as well as structural/phase changes of the LCO electrode, as reported in the literatures, are found to be the main contributors to the increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB with temperature for the specific operating temperature range. Larger increases in the Warburg elements and cell impedance are also found with cycling at higher temperature, but they do not seriously affect the state of health (SoH) of LiB as shown in this work.},

On-road testing is necessary to evaluate these benefits compared to their diesel counterparts through life-cycle assessment for both the upstream fuel production and operation stages. Three electric buses from China are operated and charged in Macao under different air-conditioning, load, and speed settings. In the minimum load scenario, the two 12-buses achieve 138-175 kWh/100 km, and the 8-bus achieves 79 kWh/100 km (system charging loss included). When air-conditioning and load are at their maximum values, the energy consumption increases by 21-27{\%}; however, air-conditioning usage exerts a greater impact than passenger load. The diesel bus on-road performance increases more significantly than the electric bus performance under low speeds, higher load, and air-conditioning use, while the electric bus energy and CO2 emission benefits increase. Across a wide range of conditions, the electric bus reduces petroleum use by 85-87{\%} compared to a diesel bus and achieves a 32-46{\%} reduction in fossil fuel use and 19-35{\%} in CO2 emissions from a life-cycle perspective.

This paper presents a model to describe the driving patterns of electric vehicles in order to provide primary input information to any mathematical programming model for optimal charging. Specifically, an inhomogeneous Markov model that captures the diurnal variation in the use of a vehicle is presented.

The model is fitted to data collected from the actual utilization of a vehicle. Inhomogeneous Markov models imply a large number of parameters.

Improving the accuracy of SOC estimation results and reducing the algorithm complexity are important for the state estimation. In this paper, a zeroaxial straight line, whose slope changes along with SOC, is used to map the predictive SOC to the predictive open circuit voltage (OCV), and thus only one parameter is used to linearize the SOC-OCV curve near the present working point. An equivalent circuit model is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of a LIB, updating the linearization parameter in the measurement equation according to the present value of the state variables, and then a standard Kalman filter is used to estimate the SOC based on the local linearization. This estimation method makes the output equation of the nonlinear battery model contain only one parameter related to its dynamic variables. This is beneficial to simplify the algorithm structure and to reduce the computation cost. The linearization method do not essentially lose the main information of the dynamic model, and its effectiveness is verified experimentally. Fully and a partially charged battery experiments indicate that the estimation error of SOC is better than 0.5{\%}.},

Furthermore, high penetration levels of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) potentially cause network reinforcement, which would have an impact on investment, operation and maintenance costs. While long run marginal cost pricing for computing node dependent network Use-of-System (UoS) tariffs has been proposed for integrating distributed generation, it remains unexplored in the context of PEV charging. Hence, this paper formulates the PEV energy retail problem with interactions in day-ahead and balancing markets from the aggregator's perspective, taking into account location dependent network UoS tariffs in the form of capacity prices for active power. While the retail tariff for the final customer is supposed fixed in the medium term, these capacity prices are accounted as costs to the aggregator. By aligning the PEV charging schedule, in time and location, to the network signals, the aggregator can hence further minimize its perceived costs. Applied to a medium voltage system with urban characteristics and spatial PEV mobility, profit optimal charging schedules for the aggregator are found. The result analysis and concluding remarks focus on the relevance of including node dependent network UoS tariffs. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The economic and environmental benefits brought by electric vehicles (EVs) cannot be fully delivered unless these vehicles are fully or partially charged by renewable energy sources (RES) such as photovoltaic system (PVS). Nevertheless, the EV charging management problem of a parking station integrated with RES is challenging due to the uncertain nature of local RES generation. This paper aims to address these difficulties by deploying an energy storage system (ESS) in parking stations and exploiting the charging and discharging scheduling of EVs to achieve better utilization of intermittent PVS for EV charging. A real-time charging optimization scheme is also formulated, using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to coordinate the charging or discharging power of EVs along with the power dispatches of power grid and ESS based on the vehicles' charging or discharging priorities and electricity price preferences. Extensive simulations show that the proposed approach not only maximizes the satisfaction of EV owners in terms of fulfilling all charging and discharging requests, but also minimizes the overall operational cost of the parking station by prioritizing the utilization of energy from PVS, ESS, and scheduling of every EV's charging and discharging.},

Firstly, the grey relational analysis (GRA) method is used to analyze the various external factors that affect the power consumption of EBs, then a characteristic library of EBs concerning similar days is established. Then, the wavelet neural network (WNN) is used to train the power consumption factors together with power consumption data in the feature library, to establish the power consumption prediction model with multiple factors. In addition, the optimal charging model of EBs is put forward, and the reasonable charging time for the EB is used to achieve the minimum operating cost of the EB company. Finally, taking the electricity consumption data of EBs in Baoding and the data of relevant factors as an example, the power consumption prediction model and the charging optimization model of the EB are verified, which provides an important reference for the optimal charging of the EB, the trip arrangement of the EB, and the maximum profit of the electric public buses.},

The BMS consists of hardware and software for battery management including, among others, algorithms determining battery states. The accurate and reliable State of Health (SOH) estimation is a challenging issue and it is a core factor of a battery energy storage system. In this paper, battery SOH monitoring methods are reviewed. To this end, different scientific and technical literature is studied and the respective approaches are classified in specific groups. The groups are organized in terms of the way the method is carried out: Experimental Techniques or Adaptive Models. Not only strengths and weaknesses for the use in online BMS applications are reviewed but also their accuracy and precision is studied. At the end of the document a potential, new and promising via in order to develop a methodology to estimate the SOH in real applications is detailed.},

abstract = {Battery state-of-charge (SOC) is a key parameter of the battery management system in the electric vehicle. To predict the practicable capacity of the battery in the degradation process, the cycle life model is built based on the aging cycle tests of the 6Ah Lithium Ion battery. Combined with the cycle life model, a new Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) model is proposed to eliminate the battery degradation's effect on the SOC estimation accuracy of the original trained model. This proposed model is verified through the 6Ah Lithium Ion battery. First, Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) and Economic Commission of Europe (ECE) cycles are experimented on the batteries under different temperatures and aging levels. Then, the robustness of the new RBFNN model against different aging levels, temperatures and loading profiles is tested with the datasets of the experiments and compared against the conventional neural network model. The simulations show that the new model can improve the accuracy of the SOC estimation effectively and has a good robustness against varying aging cycles, temperatures and loading profiles. Finally, the measurement of actual aging cycles of the battery in electric vehicles is discussed for the SOC estimation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The purpose of this study is to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the total cost of ownership (TCO) of light-duty and medium-duty diesel trucks (DTs), plug-in electric trucks (ETs), and battery-swap ETs. A simplified life cycle assessment (LCA) method and a TCO assessment method are used. Numerical results show that the average GHG emission of light-duty ETs is 69{\%} lower than that of light-duty DTs, while that of medium-duty ETs is 9.8{\%} higher than that of medium-duty DTs. As regards TCO, those of plug-in ETs and battery-swap ETs are 37.8{\%} lower and 21{\%} higher than that of light-duty DTs, while for medium-duty trucks, the TCO of plug-in and battery-swap ETs are 6.7{\%} lower and 18.9{\%} higher than that of medium-duty DTs. The main conclusion of this paper is that light-duty plug-in ETs exhibit the best performance in terms of cost saving and GHG emission reduction. Moreover, ETs show more advantages than DTs when the frequency of use is higher or when the driving environment is more congested.},

Connectivity between charging stations is an essential prerequisite for future EV adoption to alleviate user's "range anxiety". The existing charging stations fail to adopt power provision, allocation and scheduling management. To improve the existing charging infrastructure, data based on real-time information and availability of reserves at charging stations could be uploaded to the users to help them locate the nearest charging station for an EV. This research article focuses on an a interactive user application developed through SQL and PHP platform to allocate the charging slots based on estimated battery parameters, which uses data communication with charging stations to receive the slot availability information. The proposed server-based real-time forecast charging infrastructure avoids waiting times and its scheduling management efficiently prevents the EV from halting on the road due to battery drain out. The proposed model is implemented using a low-cost microcontroller and the system etiquette tested.},

abstract = {The adoption of electric vehicles (EV) has to be complemented with the right charging infrastructure roll-out. This infrastructure is already in place in many cities throughout the main markets of China, EU and USA. Public policies are both taken at regional and/or at a city level targeting both EV adoption, but also charging infrastructure management. A growing trend is the increasing idle time over the years (time an EV is connected without charging), which directly impacts on the sizing of the infrastructure, hence its cost or availability. Such a phenomenon can be regarded as an opportunity but may very well undermine the same initiatives being taken to promote adoption; in any case it must be measured, studied, and managed. The time an EV takes to charge depends on its initial/final state of charge (SOC) and the power being supplied to it. The problem however is to estimate the time the EV remains parked after charging (idle time), as it depends on many factors which simple statistical analysis cannot tackle. In this study we apply supervised machine learning to a dataset from the Netherlands and analyze three regression algorithms, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, identifying the most accurate one and main influencing parameters. The model can provide useful information for EV users, policy maker and network owners to better manage the network, targeting specific variables. The best performing model is XGBoost with an R2 score of 60.32{\%} and mean absolute error of 1.11. The parameters influencing the model the most are: The time of day in which the charging sessions start and the total energy supplied with 22.35{\%}, 15.57{\%} contribution respectively. Partial dependencies of variables and model performances are presented and implications on public policies discussed.},

abstract = {Electric buses deliver zero tailpipe emissions and have the potential to offer solutions to the air quality challenges of urban mobility in the 21st century. However, bus duty cycles are very demanding and unusually large batteries are required if electric buses are to have the range and ruggedness of their diesel counterparts. This research investigates an alternative strategy focusing on the performance of electric buses using wireless charging technology to provide opportunity charging during the working day without interrupting the timetable. In particular, the Milton Keynes demonstration project is analysed in an attempt to detect the factors that affect electric vehicles' functionality, and learn lessons retrospectively in terms of design considerations. Two different approaches are used to evaluate the performance of the eight buses which have taken over the Number 7 route at Milton Keynes since January. Firstly, an overall analysis of the buses has been conducted according to the ambient conditions, driver influence on the performance, vehicles' capabilities, vertical profile of the route as well as the driving and battery conditions. Additionally, the ground system's efficiency is analysed in order to correlate the energy drawn by the buses with the energy drawn from the network during the charging periods at the charging points. Considering the energy consumption and the system's efficiency, the actual performance of the buses and charging system is proven to be reasonably comparable to and consistent with the theoretical one while it is comfortably within the design base. This study raises important points for the crucial factors that affect electric vehicle's performance in a real life context and in a fully operational environment and could be the starting point towards proving that wireless charging is a significant game changer in terms of bus transport in the United Kingdom.},

The smart coordination of EV demand addresses an improvement in the flexibility of power systems and reduces the costs of power system investment. The uncertainty in EV drivers' behaviour is one of the main problems to solve to obtain an optimal integration of EVs into power systems. In this paper, an optimisation algorithm to coordinate the charging of EVs has been developed and implemented using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), where thermal line limits, the load on transformers, voltage limits and parking availability patterns are taken into account to establish an optimal load pattern for EV charging-based reliability. This methodology has been applied to an existing residential low-voltage system. The results indicate that a smart charging schedule for EVs leads to a flattening of the load profile, peak load shaving and the prevention of the aging of power system elements.},

abstract = {An increasing number of cities are transitioning from fossil fuel-powered buses for public transport to battery electric buses. Evaluating the energy demand of buses has become an important prerequisite for the planning and deployment of large electric bus fleets and the required charging infrastructure. A number of state-of-the-art approaches to determining the energy requirements of electric buses use individual specific energy demand values or rely on standard driving cycles, though these do not consider local bus route characteristics. Others require high-resolution measurements of the vehicles' driving profiles, which is impractical for large bus fleets. This paper presents a longitudinal dynamics model to calculate the energy demand for electric buses. The model is designed to be easily applied to large bus networks using real data sources that are commonly available to bus transit operators. This data can be derived from low-resolution data collected from day-to-day operations, where only the arrival and departure time of the buses at each bus stop are available. This approach offers a practical alternative to state-of-the-art methods and requires no high-resolution velocity profiles, which are difficult to obtain, while still taking into account the details of the operational 1characteristics of the transportation network under consideration. The application of the model is demonstrated in a case study to electrify the complete public bus network in Singapore. The results showed that the heterogeneity of driving conditions observed in a large network leads to a high variance in energy requirements between different bus lines and at different times of day. This confirms the need to take the characteristics of each individual bus route into account. In the case-study, a fully electric public bus fleet would require about 1.4 GWh per day for revenue service, which is about one per cent of Singapore's daily electricity demand. Another finding is that 50{\%} of the bus lines require less than 40 kWh per terminus-to-terminus journey, which indicates a good potential for fast opportunity charging during layover time. The results of the model should serve as the basis for further studies into battery sizes, charging strategies and charging infrastructure requirements.},
